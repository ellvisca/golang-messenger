# Messenger REST API using Go
This is another project in my attempt to learn Go Programming Language.
The main point I wanted to achieve through this project is to successfully create efficient, non-blocking and concurrent REST API.
This extends to understanding about concurrency in Go.

In this project, I will be implementing some key features from Go, such as:
* [Goroutines](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1)
* [Channels](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2)

## Built With

### Programming Language
* [Go](https://golang.org/)

### Database Management System
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database Management System
* [MongoDB Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/go/) -  MongoDB Go Driver

### Web Toolkit
* [Gorilla](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) - Web Toolkit
* [Syrup](https://github.com/maple-ai/syrup) - Enhancement for gorilla/mux
* and many more
